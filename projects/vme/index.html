                <p>Visual Mixer and Equalizer (VME) is a four-channel mixer with audio visualization and remote-control capability. The system includes analog circuity, a microcontroller with attached Wi-Fi module, and the web UI. The VME team constructed a prototype over the course of the Fall ’23 semester. </p>
                <p>See <a href="https://expo.gatech.edu/prod1/portal/portal.jsp?c=17462&p=413142918&g=413665329&id=416819941">our page on the Capstone Design website</a> for the teams presentation and poster.</p>
                <p>My role in this project was as an embedded programmer, backend developer, and PCB designer. Secondarily I worked on the frontend with audio visualization and transmission.</p>

                <p>The backend consists of a Golang application that serves the webpage and interacts with our digitally controlled ICs. Taking advantage of Go’s built-in concurrency via Goroutines and Channels, the backend runs three control loops in parallel. First is the PCM audio loop, which reads data from our ADC ALSA device, converting it to the proper data type and sending it over a channel. The second loop maintains an active websocket connection with the client, and forwards audio data from the channel to the client via the websocket. Finally, we have our command loop, which handles command data sent from the client over the websocket. Incoming command data is parsed and passed to our hardware functions, which open the proper SPI or I2C device and send corresponding data.</p>

        <h3>PCB Design</h3>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <p>The PCB was designed in EAGLE, and is a 4-layer PCB with ground and power layers, and seperate analog and digital sides. The analog side contains the audio circuitry, while the digital side contains the microcontroller and digital ICs. The PCB was designed with audio performance in mind, and includes a ground plane, power plane, and seperation between analog and digital components. The PCB was designed to be as compact as possible, while also having ergonomic testing capability.</p>
